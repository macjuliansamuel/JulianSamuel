          <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>The main goal was to create a website that showcases the work of the designer </p>

          
          <!-- <h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>
    <p>While Talent Mentoring has successfully created a mentoring platform , our challenge was to explore different ways we could expand the current website and make it easy to use. The main goal was to redesign the entire architecture while preserving the purpose of existence</p>
    <h8>The primary business needs were:</h8>
    <div class="list">
    <ol>
      <li> Improve people’s awareness about the mentoring program.</li>
      <li>Increase the number of users who enrolled in the program</li>
    </ol>
    <br></div>
    <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
      <img src="Assets/venn_diagram.png">
      <p class="imgtext">The 3 primary areas of focus for our soultion</p>
    <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>We conducted a series of user interviews to gain a better understanding of how we could effectively address the problem.</p>
    <h8>Questions asked included</h8>
    <div class="list">
    <ol>
      <li>Are you aware of mentoring programs?</li>
      <li>Increase the number of users who enrolled in the program</li>
      <li>How do you access information regarding mentoring programs ?</li>
      <li>What factors influence you the most when deciding which mentoring organization you want to be involved with ?</li>
      <li>What stops you from enrolling into a mentoring program ?</li>
    </ol><br></div>

    <p class="imgtext">Some of the interesting findings and statistics we gathered from our user surveys and interviews
    <p>After surveying 20 participants and conducting 5 user interviews, we used affinity mapping to find common themes in the data we collected. As a result of this activity, we were able to discover several major trends that we needed to address in the next phase of our design process.</p>
    <h8><strong>Here are some of the pain points we found through the survey:</strong></h8>
    <img src="Assets/Covid-19.png">
    <h2>CURRENT SITE ANALYSIS</h2>
    <p>We looked at the current Talent Mentorings’ website to determine their existing areas of focus and what could be improved to address both business and user needs. We found that overall the website had a outdated design and did not follow a content hierarchy. We identified several issues that might discourage an individual from getting involved including:</p>
  <div class="list">
    <ol>
      <li>Outdated visual design</li>
      <li>Repetitive content</li>
      <li>A lack of evidence showing the impact that Talent mentoring has made.</li>
    </ol><br> </div>

      <div class="col"><img src="Assets/OLD SS-2.png"></div>
    </div>
    <p class="imgtext">Screenshots of the current website</p>
    <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
    <p>In order to visualize the current Talent Mentoring website experience from the user’s perspective, we created a user journey map. We wanted these to journey maps to illustrate potential scenarios where a user might interact with the Talent Mentoring’ website In order to visualize the current Talent Mentoring website experience from the user’s perspective, we created a user journey map.

    <p class="imgtext">Enrollment descision making experience</p>
    <h2>Competitor/Comparitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>To gain inspiration and identify best practices for our website redesign, we conducted a competitor analysis. We began by looking at the websites of several other mentoring websites including clarify.fm and brendon.com</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img src="Assets/Image 1.png">
      <p class="imgtext" >brendon.com</p></div>
      <div class="col-sm-6" style="padding-top: 10px;"><img src="Assets/Image 2.png">
        <p class="imgtext">clarity.fm</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>One common feature we identified across the websites was the client testimonials. This was an important feature to consider in order to make the program more reliable and trustworthy.</p>

     <h2>INITIAL SKETCHES</h2>
    <p>Once we organized all our research and defined our solution, we began to explore potential designs for the website.</p>
    <img src="Assets/Portfloio-wireframe.png">
    
     <!-- <h2>WIREFRAMING</h2>
     <p>After we defined the core functionalities that we needed to include in our solution, we created quick, low-fidelity, wireframes. Using these wireframes, we were able to conduct usability testing with 4 participants. This allowed us to gather some crucial feedback to help us decide what to include in the final experience before jumping into the next iteration of our design.
       Overall users had an easy time using the website, we just needed to address a few small issues with the navigation labeling and placement of the page titles. We completed a few rounds of iterations based on testing and feedback to ensure the wireframes included everything we needed. Once the functionality of our design was finalized, we moved on to designing the UI.</p>

     <h2>DESIGN</h2>
    <p>I designed the current website to provide individuals with information about the designer, 
      and design projects.</p>

    <p class="imgtext">Landing Page</p>
    <h2>Branding and Identity</h2>
    <p>As this was a personal project, I had the liberty to choose type face and the colors.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <h2>MOBILE FRIENDLY WEBSITE</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We redesigned Talent mentoring wesite using a mobile first approach. Most of the users access the website throught the mobile phone, so using a mobile first approach caters the need of most of the users.<p></div>

    <h2>Next Step: Looking At The Bigger Picture</h2>
   <p>Moving forward with this project, I’d like to start looking at the bigger picture of how to get more mentors involved in Talent Mentoring. This includes exploring different offline methods to raise awareness for Talent Mentoring, and ultimately drive traffic to the Talent Mentoring website.

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>I learned to create lo-fi prototyopes and hi-fi prototyopes with Adobe XD</p>
  <p>I learned to create wireframes in Invision whiteboard.</p>
  <!-- <h4>1.The importance of research</h4>
  <p>Compared to previous projects, this project was a lot more research heavy. I saw this as an opportunity to strengthen my research skills and get more involved in the process of learning about our users and their needs. Some of the methods and situations which I encountered for the first time were eye-opening and will be helpful to use moving forward in my design career.</p>
