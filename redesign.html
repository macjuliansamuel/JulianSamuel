        <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>While Talent Mentoring has successfully created a mentoring platform , our challenge was to explore different ways we could expand the current website to make it --- easy to use and provide required information. Redesign the entire architecture while preserving the purpose of existence</p>
        <h8>The primary business needs were:</h8>
        <ol>
          <li> Improve people’s awareness about the mentoring program.</li>
          <li>Increase the number of users who enrolled in the program</li>
        </ol><br>
        <h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>We redesigned the current Talent Mentoring website to provide individuals with more meaningful information about the mentoring, Talent Mentorings’ mission, and programs. This would help establish trust and confidence in Talent Mentoring, increase awareness, and ultimately empower individuals to get involved.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>We conducted a series of user interviews to gain a better understanding of how we could effectively address the problem.</p>
        <h8>Questions asked included</h8>
        <ol>
          <li>Are you aware of mentoring programs?</li>
          <li>Increase the number of users who enrolled in the program</li>
          <li>How do you access information regarding mentoring programs ?</li>
          <li>What factors influence you the most when deciding which mentoring organization you want to be involved with ?</li>
          <li>What stops you from enrolling into a mentoring program ?</li>
        </ol><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>After surveying 20 participants and conducting 5 user interviews, we used affinity mapping to find common themes in the data we collected. As a result of this activity, we were able to discover several major trends that we needed to address in the next phase of our design process.</p>
        <h8>Here are some of the pain points we found through the survey:</h8>

        <h2>CURRENT SITE ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p>We looked at the current Talent Mentorings’ website to determine their existing areas of focus and what could be improved to address both business and user needs. We found that overall the website had a outdated design and did not follow a content hierarchy. So, it’s not surprising that we identified several issues that might discourage an individual from getting involved including:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Are you aware of mentoring programs?</li>
          <li>An inefficient site map (navigation)
          <li>Lots of repetitive content</li>
          <li>A lack of evidence showing the impact that Talent mentoring has made.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
        <p>In order to visualize the current Talent Mentoring website experience from the user’s perspective, we created a user journey map. We wanted these to journey maps to illustrate potential scenarios where a user might interact with the Talent Mentoring’ website In order to visualize the current Talent Mentoring website experience from the user’s perspective, we created a user journey map.

        <h2>Competitor/Comparitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>To gain inspiration and identify best practices for our website redesign, we conducted a competitor analysis. We began by looking at the websites of several other mentoring websites including clarify.fm and brendon.com</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col"><img src="Assets/Image 1.png"></div>
          <div class="col"><img src="Assets/Image 2.png"></div>
        </div>
        <p>One common feature we identified across the websites was the client testimonials. This was an important feature to consider in order to make the program more reliable and trustworthy.One common feature we identified across the websites was the client testimonials.

        <h2>INITIAL SKETCHES</h2>
        <p>Once we organized all our research and defined our solution, we began to explore potential designs for the website.</p>

        <img src="Assets/Registration - wireframe.png">
        <h2>WIREFRAMING</h2>
        <p>After we defined the core functionalities that we needed to include in our solution, we created quick, low-fidelity, wireframes. Using these wireframes, we were able to conduct usability testing with 4 participants. This allowed us to gather some crucial feedback to help us decide what to include in the final experience before jumping into the next iteration of our design.
          Overall users had an easy time using the website, we just needed to address a few small issues with the navigation labeling and placement of the page titles. We completed a few rounds of iterations based on testing and feedback to ensure the wireframes included everything we needed. Once the functionality of our design was finalized, we moved on to designing the UI.</p>
