                  <p>Online shopping has become a popular shopping method ever since the internet declared a takeover. Furniture and other household items are some of the common things bought online. Although purchasing these products online is highly convenient, it comes with its own disadvantages. The major disadvantage of purchasing products online is that the customer solely relies on the picture offered on the website to determine if the product will fit in their home or in the required environment. However, in many cases, pictures are unable to convey the necessary information needed to determine if the furniture will fit in the required environment. For example, the size of the furniture will not fit in the available space, the color of the furniture might not go along with the background color.   This ordeal can be overcome using augmented reality.

              <h4>The Problem</h4>
              <p>The applications that are currently being used are based on marker detecting systems. It uses a marker-based detection to detect the plane and superimpose the furniture. The marker is usually a QR code, Bar Code or Image. Once the marker is seen and detected through the camera, the furniture is superimposed above the marker. This lets the customer see what it looks like in the real world. 
                    <br><br>
                It requires a physical marker such as a QR code, Bar code or an image to detect the plane. Only when the marker is detected the furniture can be superimposed in the real world. And the furniture can be placed only above the marker, it lacks the flexibility to be moved around and rotated.  Furthermore, the application can superimpose only one furniture at a time. So it becomes a great ordeal when two furniture needs to be bought together. Also, the current system cannot detect depth enough to give a full-on immersive experience.
